english-words-py can import a set of all english words.
-From here, we take a sliding window of 10 (non-special) characters, check every substring length 4 and above to see if it is a word, add these words to the url's set
--From here, use WordNet to extract similar words,
--Group urls together that have similar words in the URL - we want googlecash.co and paypalmoney.net grouped together.
---This will begin to cluster values, which will allow our classification

Another dimension - number of subdirectorires.

From here, we have some multidimensional space, use SVM to cluster.
